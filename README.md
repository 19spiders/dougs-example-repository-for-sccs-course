The *.gitignore* is to tell R to ignore copying any folders to github, those would be data folders and large datasets that github is not for storage of. Github is for small files of code only, not outputs or figures. 
Dont forget to save! 
Then sync changes from R (local) to Github (remote):
1. Pull 2. Stage 3. Commit 4. Push 
Pull - is pulling from the remote github repo to R, to make sure you are working on the most up-to-date copy in R. Always start work with a Pull. 
Stage - tells github you'll be syncing soon. Always save before staging. To stage tick the box next to the file to sync.
Commit - this is  the copy you want to sync to Github - a snapshot. useful if you make errors, then you can go back. So can Commit numerous times to track your work. Commits are like anchors on a trad climb, you cant fall below the most recent gear.
